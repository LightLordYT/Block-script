#Lightweight script for blocking sites

todos:
localstorage that adds up all time in site
make it into a graph to chart the data
somehow inject code without tampermonkey, discreet (chrome bookmark?)
reinstall after uninstall somehow

features:
 - bootloader finished
 - passed greasyfork's cdn check with manual install
 - code is harder to find ( i dont want it to be closed sourced )
 - bootloader js, redirect for greasyfork, and pure version
 - no manual update needed because of cdn :)
